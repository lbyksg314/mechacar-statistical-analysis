According to the analysis, the vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero.

The result shows that the probability of the p-value of intercept, the vehicle length and the ground clearance are much smaller than the significant level 0.05 that we could reject the null hypothesis. So, the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero.

This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

According to the result, the multiple R-squared is 0.7149, which means 71.49% of the variability of our dependent variable is explained using this linear model. The p-value is 5.35x10^(-11).
